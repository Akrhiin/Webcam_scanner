WEBCAM SCANNER
==================================================
CURRENT STATUS:
Scanner is able to show constant feed from webcam in new window.
Upon keypress [ESC], closes window.  Upon keypress [SPACE], prompts user for file name and saves frame as new png in main directory.

I wrote this script to be used in tandem with Meshroom for photogrammetry purposes, but could likely be repurposed to suit a variety of needs.
Currently operational on my windows 10/11 boxes, not quite there for linux distros.
